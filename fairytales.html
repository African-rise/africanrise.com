         <h2> Cinderella </h2>
         <p>Once upon a time there was a nobleman who had a sweet wife and daughter. But his wife died, and his second one was horrid. She had two daughters whose bad tempers had given them ugly faces. They were mean to their stepsister, Ella. She had to sweep the cinders from the grate, so they called her Cinderella. One day, the king’s son sent out invitations to a grand ball at the palace. The ugly sisters spent ages deciding what to wear. And Cinderella had to help them get dressed and brush their hair. There was no question of Cinderella going to the ball in her rags! When the ugly sisters had left for the ball, Cinderella burst into tears. “How I wish I could go too!” she cried. Suddenly, her fairy godmother appeared.<br> “Don’t cry child,” she said. “Of course you can go to the ball! But first we’ll need a few bits and pieces get me one pumpkin, six little mice, one large rat, and six lizards.” Well, Cinderella couldn’t think how a pumpkin and some animals were going to get her to the ball, but she did as her godmother asked. Her fairy godmother waved her wand and … whoosh! The pumpkin disappeared, and in its place stood a beautiful coach. Then she waved her wand again. The six little mice turned into a team of handsome carriage horses. The rat was soon a rather fat coachman, and the lizards became six footmen. So now Cinderella had a lovely coach to take her to the ball. But she was still in her rags. Her godmother smiled and tapped her once with her wand. Immediately, Cinderella was dressed in shimmering gold. “Now, off you go,” said her godmother. “But, remember, at midnight everything will go back to the way it was. So you must be home before then.” Cinderella promised, then stepped into her beautiful coach.The six white horses set off toward the king’s palace. Everyone at the ball stopped dancing when the mysterious stranger arrived. Cinderella looked so beautiful in her gold dress that everyone thought she was a princess from a foreign country. Even her two stepsisters were fooled! The prince was just as curious as everyone else. From the moment Cinderella came into the ballroom, he danced with no one else. By the end of the evening, he was madly in love with his beautiful “princess,” and he didn’t even know her name. And Cinderella was just as much in love with the prince. But as they were dancing, Cinderella suddenly heard the chimes of the palace clock. “Oh no!” she cried. “It must be midnight.” Cinderella ran away from the prince, out of the ballroom, and down the palace steps, losing one of her glass slippers along the way. By the time she reached the bottom step, the clock had finished striking twelve and Cinderella was in rags again. The prince ran after Cinderella, but all he found was the beautiful glass slipper from the steps. “Send out a proclamation!” he said. “I will marry the person whose foot fits this slipper! We’ll ask every woman in the kingdom to try on the slipper.” So the prince went to every house in the kingdom, and soon he came to the house where Cinderella lived with her stepsisters. Of course, the ugly sisters were very eager to try their luck. But no matter how hard they pushed their big feet into the glass slipper, it didn’t fit. So Cinderella came forward to try on the slipper. To the amazement of her stepsisters, it fitted perfectly. The prince looked up at Cinderella’s face and recognized the beautiful princess he had danced with at the ball. So he married Cinderella, and, unlike the stepsisters, they lived happily ever after.

          <h2>The Selfish Giant</h2>
          <p>There was once a giant who wasn’t nice at all. He went away to visit a friend and didn’t come back for seven years. While he was away, children came to play in the giant’s lovely gardens. They were happy and forgot all about him. Then the giant came back. “What are you doing?” he bellowed, and all the children ran away. So the giant built a tall wall, and put up a notice, warning the children to keep out. At first the giant was pleased. Then he noticed that no birds came and sang in his gardens any more. And worse, it was always winter. The giant became sad. Then one morning the song of a bird woke the giant. He looked out and saw that the children had come back. They had crept through a hole in the wall, and now the gardens were full of flowers and birds. The giant tore down the wall and promised never to be selfish again.</p>
